We have not yet decided on specific licensing terms for this software as it is in a very early stage.  We guarantee that it will be available under an open source license, the authors still need to figure out and agree upon speciically which one.  Until we have done so (and found a better name), any use of teh source code or software from this project must be discussed and allowed specifically by the authors (contact through pymt-dev mailing list on google groups, or #pymt on irc.freenode.net).  Simmilarly, for now any changes to teh software must be resubmitted to the project (similar to teh GPL license).
